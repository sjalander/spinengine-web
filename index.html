		<p>The SpinENGINE project will lay the foundations for
		a new, massively parallel, platform based on emergent
		behaviour in nanomagnet ensembles. The project will an
		efficient, highly scalable, and easily reproducible
		platform meeting the data challenges in our
		increasingly data-rich society. We will build upon our
		recent discoveries and use complex, nonlinear, and
		highly tunable interactions in such ensembles to
		realize a hardware platform for “Reservoir Computing”,
		a biologically-inspired computational approach. Our
		critical hypothesis is that the synergies between the
		inherent properties of nanomagnet ensembles and those
		required for reservoir computing will enable the
		efficient creation of a highly adaptive computational
		platform for the analysis of complex, dynamic data
		sets. This has the potential to greatly outperform
		current approaches using conventional CMOS
		hardware.</p>
				
		<p>SpinENGINE will bring together a multidisciplinary
		team of researchers with expertise in computer
		science, condensed matter physics, material science,
		computational modelling, and high-resolution
		microscopy. This will enable us to simultaneously
		explore the fundamental behaviours of nanomagnet
		ensembles and understand how these can be harnessed
		for useful computation. By the end of the project, we
		aim to fabricate a proof-of-concept device capable of
		solving pattern recognition and classification
		problems, and, in collaboration with our industrial
		partner, IBM, produce a roadmap to the further scaling
		and commercialization of our computational
		platform. Success in the SpinENGINE project will have
		vast implications for data analysis at all scales,

		    <b>Abstract:</b>
		    We present flatspin, a novel simulator for
		    systems of interacting mesoscopic spins on a
		    lattice, also known as artificial spin ice
		    (ASI). Our magnetic switching criteria enables
		    ASI dynamics to be captured in a dipole

		    <b>Abstract: </b>
		    Emergent behaviors occur when
		    simple interactions between a system's constituent
		    elements produce properties that the individual
		    elements do not exhibit in isolation. This article
		    reports tunable emergent behaviors observed in
		    domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of
		    interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under
		    an applied rotating magnetic field. DWs interact
		    stochastically at ring junctions to create
		    mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These
		    combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent
		    equilibrium DW population that is a robust and
		    emergent property of the array, despite highly
		    varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic
		    ring arrays’ properties (e.g., non-linear behavior,
		    “fading memory” to changes in field, fabrication
		    repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an
		    interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir
		    computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in
		    hardware. By way of example, simulations of ring
		    arrays performing RC approaches 100% success in
		    classifying spoken digits for single speakers.

		    <b>Abstract:</b>
		    We propose thermally driven,
		    voltage-controlled superparamagnetic ensembles as
		    low-energy platforms for hardware-based reservoir
		    computing. In the proposed devices, thermal noise
		    is used to drive the ensembles' magnetization
		    dynamics, while control of their net magnetization
		    states is provided by strain-mediated voltage
		    inputs. Using an ensemble of CoFeB nanodots as an
		    example, we use analytical models and
		    micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate how such
		    a device can function as a reservoir and perform
		    two benchmark machine learning tasks (spoken digit
		    recognition and chaotic time series prediction)
		    with competitive performance. Our results indicate
		    robust performance on timescales from microseconds
		    to milliseconds, potentially allowing such a
		    reservoir to be tuned to perform a wide range of
		    real-time tasks, from decision making in
		    driverless cars (fast) to speech recognition
		    (slow). The low energy consumption expected for
		    such a device makes it an ideal candidate for use
		    in edge computing applications that require low
		    latency and power.

		    The development of spintronic

		    propose a spintronic oscillator based on the

		    disk imprinted on an out-of-plane magnetized slab,
		    the oscillator takes a polar vortex-like magnetic
		    structure in the disk stabilized by a strong
		    Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. By means of
		    micromagnetic simulations, we investigate its
		    dynamic properties under applied spin current, and
		    by placing an ensemble of oscillators in the near
		    vicinity, we demonstrate their synchronization
		    with different resonant frequencies. Finally, we
		    show their potential application in neuromorphic
		    computing using a network with six oscillators.

		    Two-dimensional lattices of

		    arranged on a hexagonal lattice. The arrays were
		    shaped as hexagons, squares, and rectangles to
		    investigate finite-size effects in the SFM domain
		    structure for such arrays. The resulting domain
		    patterns were examined using x-ray magnetic
		    circular dichroism photoemission electron
		    microscopy. At room temperature, we find these SFM

		    <b>Abstract:</b>
		    Arrangements of nanomagnets known as artificial

		    <b>Abstract:</b>
		    Ensembles of interacting nanomagnets known as
		    Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) have become a promising
		    new substrate for computation. Properties such as

		    it of particular interest for unconventional and

		    <b>Abstract:</b>
		    We present flatspin, a novel simulator for

		    approximation. Temperature is modelled as an

		    magnetization reversal of “pinwheel” ASI is
		    reproduced, for the first time, in a dipole
